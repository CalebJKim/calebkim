       Hello! I'm your innovative entrepreneur, Caleb Kim.
    </h1>
    <p id="aboutbody">
      I am a senior at Henry M. Gunn High School invested in learning all about technology, entrepreneurship, and product development/management. 
      I'm all about innovation, and love working on projects that challenge the status quo. I am always open to educate myself, and am passionate about project-based learning as I have
      intellectually grown immense amounts from exploring my own passions in constructing business models, vertically differentiating product concepts, and coding/building both software and hardware
      components of my technological ventures. I am hoping to use my experiences and knowledge to build impactful technology that caters to underserved necessities both now and in the future.

    <p id="aboutpersonal">
      Aside from my academic and work life, I love traveling and spending time with my family and friends. Some of my favorite activities are arranging songs for and playing the guitar,
      working out, and exploring new foods to eat. At home, I spend time in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes. I am also an avid reader and stock trader.
